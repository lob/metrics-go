# metrics-go

This package provides an interface for reporting metrics to statsd,
along with Echo middleware for use with HTTP APIs.

## Usage

Include the metrics-go package in your project:

```go
import (
    "github.com/lob/metrics-go"
)
```

Create a new Metrics client:

```go

cfg := metrics.Config{
    Namespace: "myapp",
}
m := metrics.New(cfg)
```

The metric `Namespace` *must* be provided.

All metrics reported from the instance will have the environment, container, and release added as tags.

You may also pass additional tags to all `metrics` methods as variadic string arguments.

You may wish to embed the `metrics.Config` struct in your applications configuration
struct for convenience.

### Count

```go
m.Count("event-counter", 1)
```

### Gauge
```go
m.Gauge("num-workers", 5)
```

### Histogram

```go
m.Histogram("queue-depth", 10)
```

### Close
```go
m.Close()
```

### Timers

```go
t := metrics.NewTimer("api-call")

err := apiCall()
if err != nil {
    // End also takes tags that are added to the timer metric
    t.End("state:failed")
} else {
    t.End("state:success")
}
```

### Middleware

This package includes middleware suitable for use with Echo servers.

```go

m := metrics.New(cfg)
e := echo.New()
e.Use(metrics.Middleware(m))

```

## Lambda

The server-less [AWS Lambda Service](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/monitoring-lambda-functions-datadog/) allows us to do expensive computations without having to manage extra infrastructure.
However, without control of the actual server the code is running on, it's impossible to run a Datadog agent on or alongside the host.
This makes using a normal StatsD client unfeasible.
Instead, we can write metrics to logs that Datadog reads through an AWS account integration as detailed [here](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/monitoring-lambda-functions-datadog/#beyond-standard-metrics).

### Configuration

The only differences in configuring this library for a lambda function instead of a standard Go library are:
1. You must set `Lambda: true` in the metrics.Config.
2. You must set `LambdaLogger` to a struct that implements the `io.WriteCloser` interface in the metrics.Config.
